# SMEAGL
SMEAGL (Simulated Microbial Evolution and Genomic LGT) is designed to simulate microbial ecology and evolution. The initial application is to explore the hypothesis that high abundances of DNA mobility elements in some deep sea hydrothermal vent microbiomes may be more strongly selected in low-richness communities.
